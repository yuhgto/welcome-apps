   - **Authorization Callback URL:** Add the following Authorization Callback URL: `https://<your_tunnel_URL>/auth/github/callback`

      ```
    2. Choose the app to set environment variables > set > enter the secret key > then enter the value of the secret. The secret will be injected into process.env of your deployment.
