## Overview

This is the "Github Integration" example Monday app.

It can implement the following recipes: 
- When **status** changes to **something**, create an **issue** in **this repository**
- When an issue is created in **this repository**, create an **item**

### Features
This app demonstrates how to use:

- integration recipe
- custom action
- custom trigger
- call authentication with JWT
- query monday API using short lived token (seamless authentication)
- remote options for custom fields
- item mapping
- OAuth proccess to 3rd party

### Extending the sample code

The code is designed to be easy to understand and extend to any other API. We use JSDoc to document the main functions. There are `@todo` tags to explain some of the parts you need to adapt to your own API.
